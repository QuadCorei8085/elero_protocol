# elero radio configuration
Elero GmbH - 868 radio VarioTel2

When you switch on the remote it loads the config found in C file.

This is an example of pressing DOWN a button on the VarioTel2:
"0x1B 0x01 0x44 0x12 0x00 0x01 0x11 0x1A 0x01 0x0D 0x1A 0x01 0x0D 0x1A 0x01 0x0D 0x01 0x11 0x00 0x03 0x54 0xF4 0xEE 0xBC 0x6C 0xDE 0xA4 0x02"

Separate them in blocks:
[0x1B] [0x01] [0x44 0x12 0x00 0x01 0x11] [0x1A 0x01 0x0D] [0x1A 0x01 0x0D] [0x1A 0x01 0x0D] [0x01 0x11] [0x00 0x03 0x54 0xF4 0xEE 0xBC 0x6C 0xDE 0xA4 0x02]"

Where
[0x1B] - packet length.
[0x01]  - msg counter/id always increments by 1
[0x44 0x12 0x00 0x01 0x11] - msg header
[0x1A 0x01 0x0D] [0x1A 0x01 0x0D] [0x1A 0x01 0x0D] - src, sender, dst (for remote its always the same - for hopping/relaying it migth differ)
[0x01 0x11] - payload info
[0x00 0x03 0x54 0xF4 0xEE 0xBC 0x6C 0xDE 0xA4 0x02] - payload

payload contains button status (1 is button pressed 0 is released) for a certain message type.
paylaod is "encrypted" via a byte-swapping + xoring + magic addition, nothing fancy.

Once you know a paylaod you can decrypt it with the supplied python script to show you the content of the message.

If you have constructed your own payload you can use the rolling index in the message but not necessary just use a unique one the receiver accepts them anyways.
